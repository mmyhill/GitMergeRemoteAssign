Q1- What does clone set the variable origin to represent?The clone command automatically sets the origin to represent the remote repositiory from which the directory was cloned (in this case gitHub).

Q2- What does the command git push --set-upstream origin master do?This command sets the url (of the remote repositiory) to which you want to make commits. What does remote tracking mean in this context? In this context, you are setting up the ability to commit to the remote repositiory (the beginning of remote tracking)# GitMergeRemoteAssign
